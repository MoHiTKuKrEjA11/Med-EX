Time management is crucial for personal and professional success, as it allows us to prioritize tasks, and achieve goals. And many of us had to wait at the hospitals for a doctor's appointment. Sometimes it takes a long and we are bound to sit there. We are here to help you by reducing the waiting time and managing the appointment allocation. We will be creating a web-based application in which we will implement a Machine Learning Model to allow users to avail following features.
 --> AI-enabled Waiting Time
 --> Information Accessibility
 --> Real-Time Doctor Availability
